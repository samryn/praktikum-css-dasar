            lorem ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
        lorem ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
        when an unkown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type 
        specimen book. it has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
        electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. it was popularised in
        the 1960s with the release of letraset sheets containing lorem ipsum passages, 
        and more recently with desktop publishing software like aldus pagemaker including versions of lorem ipsum.

        it is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its
            layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is 
            that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'content here content here', making
            it look like readable english. many desktop
            publishing packages and web page editors now use lorem ipsum as their default modeltext, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.
            various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the 
            like)
